# HelloWorld
This is just some tests to see how GitHub works.
I am a clinical engineer exploring ways of using data in healthcare. 
I got my B.A.Sc. in mechanical engineering from the University of Waterloo and a master's degree in clinical engineering from the University of Toronto.
I am pretty much exclusively working in Python at the moment.
